# Eric Demo Express Server (under construction)
Welcome! I'm Eric Cheng, and this repository is one of my personal demo project to showcase my full stack and AI development skills.

This project serves as a demonstration of my Node Js Express Server knowledge and its API development paradigms. It is a simple Express server that serves as a backend for my [Eric Demo React App](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net)

## Demo Site

You can view [My Demo Website](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net) built using React, connected to this API backend, a C# backend and a GoLang backend.

## Goals

1. Demonstrate my Node Js, Typescript and Express server knowledge.
2. Demonstrate both Restful API and GraphQL API.
3. Demonstrate CICD pipeline setup with Github Actions, Docker Hub and Azure Web App.
4. Keep it as a simple reference for my personal use.

## Project Ambition

Beyond this Express Server implementation, my overarching objective is to create a multi-language demo project that showcases my knowledge and skills. [My Demo Website](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net) is connected to this Express server, another API server in C#, and anotehr API server in GoLang.
